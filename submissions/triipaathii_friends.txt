Found 4 differences: 

    1. The cup kept on the table at the right with white circles, has fewer white circles than in 1st image.
    2. The part of the sofa at left where the lady with a bottle sitting with its support, has no design in the 2nd image.
    3. The lady with a white shirt sitting on the couch, above here there are 3 cups or pot. The top had a different color in both images.
    4. At exactly center top, between 2 white round stuff hanging, there is a yellow shining design in 1st image, but no such thing was found in 2nd image.
